# OysteR
This series of R scripts are used for end-to-end workflow of wrangling, analyzing, and visualizing data collected from annual surveys of North Carolina's various statewide shellfish rehabilitation programs (oyster restoration work). These initiatives include surveying of the oyster sanctuaries, cultch reefs, and natural reefs. This repository includes R scripts used for validating collected data, creating visualizations, and analyzing size class densities -- a key metric for understanding population dynamics on oyster reefs. These programs use two methodologies for collecting oyster samples on the various reefs. More information about each program and their respective methodologies can be found below.

**Oyster Sanctuary**

North Carolina’s Division of Marine Fisheries has been permitting, constructing, and monitoring oyster sanctuaries in Pamlico Sound since 1996. These subtidal oyster reefs are constructed with various materials commonly referred to alternative substrates in the field of oyster restoration. Subtidal oyster reefs provide a pluthera of ecosystem services that improve habitat quality such as the provision of nursery and foraging habitat for other species, as well as enhanced water filtration, reducing turbidity and excess nutrients in the estuary. The oyster sanctuaries of Pamlico Sound are closed to harvest, thereby encouraging the growth of large, healthy oyster populations that act as broodstock and a larval insurance policy. As of 2026, the Oyster Sanctuary Network includes 17 active sites across 789 acres. Over 330,000 tons of aggregate materials have been deployed to create three dimensionally complex reef habitat.  

Annual monitoring efforts are conducted by SCUBA certified biologists and technicians as teams conduct quantitative surveys on each oyster sanctuary, collecting data on the density and population structure of each site, as well as other species present and relevant abiotic data. These surveys provide insight into the degree of sanctuary persistence and are used to refine site selection and construction methods for future sanctuary sites and habitat enhancement.

**Deepwater Oyster Recovery Areas (DORAs)**

In 2025, North Carolina's Marine Fisheries Commission approved the establishment of deepwater oyster recovery areas (DORAs). Situated at the mouths of the Neuse and Pamlico rivers, these areas are closed to commercial dredging in an effort to understand the natural resilience and rate of vertical accretion on natural oyster reefs in the absence of harvest pressure. These areas have documented historical presence of oyster reefs, but have also been subject to frequent low dissolved oxygen events in recent decades. SCUBA monitoring efforts and side scan sonar surveys are being conducted by NCDMF to observe the change of reef footprint and density metrics within the DORAs. The same methodology employed by the Sanctuary Program is being used to study the oyster reefs in the DORAs. By collecting this data over the coming years, informed management decisions about Pamlico Sound's subtidal oyster reefs can be made with the aim of developing a sustainable fishery.

**Cultch Planting**

Since 1915 NCDMF has been creating low relief oyster reefs with the intent to make additional areas available for commercial harvest. With the aim of reducing harvest pressure on natural oyster reefs, the Cultch Planting Program creates accessible and reliable areas for participants in the industry. Initially recycled shell (cultch) was used as the primary substrate but due to increased demand and cost, alternative materials, such as small marl limestone rock, are used today to maximize the footprint of annual planting efforts. 

Since 1982 over 1,660 cultch sites have been planted along North Carolina's coastline with over 600,000 bushels of shell and/or marl limestone (#4). Sites range between 0.5 to 10 acres in size. Recently, a network of large 10-acre sites have been developed in Pamlico Sound as part of an initial strategy to establish a series of rotationally managed cultch sites open to harvest for the entirety of the mechanical oyster season.

Monitoring of cultch sites utilizes hydraulic patent tongs to collect standardized samples for quantifying oyster density metrics. Tong surveys are conducted on recently planted cultch sites (<4 years old), rotationally managed sites to determine open/closure status, and for in-season management of the mechnical fishery. NCDMF's cultch planting efforts have been documented with coordinates and abiotic data since 1982. The network of cultch reefs along with the results of recent tong surveys (2020-present) are visualized on this [dashboard](https://ncdenr.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/3c526193ddb94addb1b764be8f86afc7). Oyster data presented within the dashboard are the product of these scripts in this repository.
